# dbus-signals
Basic performance testing for dbus signals, see [blog posting](http://blog.asleson.org/2015/09/01/d-bus-signaling-performance/) for more information.

#### Trying it out
1. Copy the configuration file to allow service to be run on the system bus
  * `# cp org.fubar.signal1.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/`
2. Build the C version
  * `# ./build.sh`
3. Run the test service
  * `# ./spamsignals server`
4. Run the test client
  * `# ./spamsignals client`
5. Run the testcase
  * `# python test.py`
6. Look at stdout from test client

Columns are:
payload byte size, average diff time, messages/sec, MiB/sec, Number of signals received

#### Notes:
* To run python server/client verson change ./spamsignals to ./spamsignals.py
* To enable kdbus, append kdbus=1 to kernel command line while having the kdbus kernel module located somewhere where is can be found, like: ```/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/ipc/kdbus/```
